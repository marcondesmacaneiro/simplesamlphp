AJAX iFrame Single Log-Out
--------------------------

If you have read about the AJAX iFrame Single Log-Out approach at Andreas' blog and want to enable it, edit your saml20-idp-hosted.php metadata, and add this configuration line for the IdP:

	'logouttype' => 'iframe',

Notice that when setting this option after already having shared metadata with Service Providers, you need to send new metadata. The automatically genereated metadata will change.

Attribute Release Consent
-------------------------

The attribute release consent is documented in a separate document.
