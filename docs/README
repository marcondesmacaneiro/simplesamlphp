Installation instructions:
==========================

Store the simplesamlphp directory somewhere...

In there there is a www directory, it have to be accessible from web, on the root of a vhost. The www can be moved outside the simplesamlphp folder. You can in example drop the content of the www folder into your existing web site folder.

IF you decide to move the www folder out of the simplesamlphp folder, then you need to update the www/_include.php file properly.

Next, configure config.php:
- set the path and hostnames.
- Use sam.feide.no as default idp.
- Set the default duration of a session to be in example 3 hours.


Then, configure saml20-sp-hosted to match your SP metadata. Change dev.andreas.feide.no to your hostname. Contact feide to ensure that your meta data is added to the Feide IdP.

Then configure the saml20-idp-remote to match Feide. If there exists an entry for sam.feide.no it is probably already there.

Then test the /example-simple/saml2-example.php log in with the feide test user, and look at the attributes. then test sp initated logout.

Look at the example code of how to integrate with a service.
