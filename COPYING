simpleSAMLphp is based on code from Sun OpenSSO Extensions (formerly known as Lightbulb).
The initial versions of the SAML 2.0 part was written by Pat Patterson, Sun.

The functionality have been extended and Andreas Åkre Solberg, UNINETT, has rewritten the
library and added support for Shibboleth IdP/SP, and SAML 2.0 IdP. The product is used to 
bridge AAI protocols in the GÉANT project, http://geant2.net
